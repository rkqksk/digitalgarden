People love to argue minor points, partially because they feel it absolves them from actually having to do anything. You know what? Let the fools debate the details. I decided to learn about money by taking small steps to manage my own spending.

10.


11.
There's a group of people- mostly young, disaffected people- who have decided it's easier to be cynical than to improve themselves.

People actually compete to see who's bigger victim.

12.
This is where the victim mindset comes in. So many people complain about politicians and sociological problems without looking around at their own behavior. They give up at the first sign of failure. If you want to be a passenger in life, fine - go with the flow.

14.
When others are scared, there are bargains to be found.

15.
The single most important factor to getting rich is getting started, not being smartest person in the room.

The problem, and the solution, is you.

16.
It's to live your life and let money serve you. So instead of saying, "How much money do i need to make?" you'll say, "What do I want to do with my life - and how can I use money to do it?"

Think about it : 85% percent of the way is far better than zero percent.

17.
Investment isn't about being sexy - it's about making money, and when you look at investment literatures, buy and hold investing wins over the long term, every time.

19.
Most people never spend even ten minutes thinking through what "rich" means to them.

I consider myself rich now that I can do these things :
Make career decisions because I want to, not because of money
Help my parents with their retirement, so they don't have to work if they don't want to
Spend extravagantly on the things I love and be relentlessly frugal about the things I don't(e.g., live in a nice apartment in New York but not own a car)

20.
10 Rules for a rich life
A rich life means you can spend extravagantly on the things you love as long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't.
Focus on the Big Wins - the five to ten things that get you disproportionate results, including automating your savings and investing, finding a job you love, and negotiating your salary. Get the Big Wins right and you can order as many lattes as you want.
Investing should be very boring - and very profitable - over the long term. I get more excited eating tacos than checking my investment returns.
There's limit to how much you can cut, but no limit to how much you can earn. I have readers who earn $50,000/year and ones who earn $750,000/year. They both buy the same loaves of bread. Controlling spending is important, but earning become super-linear.
Your friends and family will have lots of "tips" once you begin your financial journey. Listen politely, then stick to the program.
Build a collection of "spending frameworks" to use when deciding on buying something. Most people default to restrictive rules("I need to cut back on eating out....."), but you can flip it and decide what you'll always spend on, like my book-buying rule : If you're thinking about buying a book, just buy it. Don't waste five second debating it. Applying even on new idea from a book is worth it.(like this one.)
Beware of the endless search for "advanced" tips. So many people seek out high-level answers to avoid the real, hard work of improving step by step. It's easier to dream about winning the Boston Marathon than to go out for a ten-minute jog every morning. Sometimes the most advanced thing you can do is the basics, consistently.
You're in control. This isn't a Disney movie and nobody's coming to rescue you. Fortunately, you can take control of your finances and build your rich life.
Part of creating your rich life is the willingness to be unapologetically different. Once money isn't a primary constraint, you'ill have the freedom to design your own rich life, which will almost certainly be different from the average person's. Embrace it. this is the fun part!
Live life outside the spreadsheet. Once you automative your money using the system in the book, you'll see that the most important part of a rich life is outside the spreadsheet - it involves relationship, new experiences, and giving back. You earned it.

22.
Week 1, You will set up your credit cards, pay off debt, and learn how to master your credit history and free credit rewards.
Week 2, You'll set up the tight bank accounts.
Week 3, You'll open a 401(k) and an investment account(even if you have just $100 to start).
Week 4, You'll figure how much you're spending. And then you'll figure out how to make your money go where you want it go.
Week 5, You'll automate your new infrastructure to make your accounts play together nicely.
Week 6, You'll learn why investing isn't the same as picking stocks and how you can get the most out of the market with very little work.

39.
You'll quietly save thousand by understanding the invisible importance of credit, paying your bills on time, and having a better credit score.

42.
(Note : Always end your sentence with strength. Don't say, "Can you remove this?" Say, "I'd like to have this removed.")





95.
Even if you're earning a solid rate in a high-interest savings account, it will take you a long, long time to get a substantial return. Put simply, saving is not enough. You need a way to put that money to work for you so it earns more than even the highest-yielding savings account, and investing is the first and best way to do it.
"Compounding," Albert Einstein said, "is mankind's greatest invention because it allows for the reliable, systematic accumulation of wealth."
